# datastructure_project_bookstore
In this project, we plan to implement a book selling system. A circular one-way linked list has been designed and in each node of the list, the information of a book that includes the name of the book, the name of the author, the year of publication and its price, which contains the books available in the bookstore. People who enter the bookstore are given a sheet that indicates their turn when paying for books to the cash register, which must be implemented in a queue. In this bookstore, the queue takers are separated from the sisters. And also, every person in the bookstore has a shopping basket in which he puts his books, and you must keep the names and prices of the books in the basket in a stack. You let its price be calculated in the cash register for the first time.
